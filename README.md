# cloudflare-pages-cleanup

Deletes old [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) deployments with
min/max retention, optional age threshold, **alias & active production
protection**, strict failure on errors, and always emits a `report.json`
artifact.

Given the above settings to prune old releases the following two conditions are
always true:

- Active production deployment is always protected (resolved via
  `canonical_deployment` with a heuristic fallback).
- Any deployment with aliases/custom domains is always protected.

## Outputs

| Name              | Type    | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consideredCount` | Integer | Number of candidates examined beyond the retention window (after protections) |
| `deletedCount`    | Integer | Number of deployments deleted in this run                                     |
| `keptCount`       | Integer | Number of deployments kept (includes protected and within retention)          |
| `deletedIds`      | String  | Comma-separated list of deleted deployment IDs                                |

## Example Usage

You can run this action on a schedule, workflow dispatch, or part of a normal
workflow that runs on push or pull request:

```yaml
jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mfinelli/cloudflare-pages-cleanup@v1
        with:
          cloudflare_account_id: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          cloudflare_api_token: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          project: my-pages-project
          dry_run: true
```
